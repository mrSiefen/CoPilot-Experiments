## What is CoPilot?

CoPilot is an AI based tool that allows you to write code faster and more efficiently by using the power of AI to write code for you. It is still in beta, but it is available right now for you to try out and use. It is available for free for students and educators.

CoPilot is like auto complete on steroids! By using machine learning, and being trained on publicly available code, CoPilot can write code for you based on what you are trying to do. It can write code for you in Python, Java, C++, and C. It can speed up your coding process by 10x or more!

## How can I use it for FRC?

Thankfully many teams use the WPILib VSCode ide. This means that you can use CoPilot with it! CoPilot is available as a VSCode extension. You will need to sign up for an account on the CoPilot website. This also requires you to sign up for a free GitHub account and I would recommend setting it up under the Student Resource Pack.

After signing up for an account, and installing the CoPilot extension, you can start using it. You can use CoPilot by typing in your code and then pressing `Alt + Enter` to show the CoPilot suggestions. You can then use the arrow keys to move up and down the list of suggestions. You can also use the mouse to select a suggestion. 

As you are writing your code suggestions will appear. You can use these suggestions to help you write your code. To turn off CoPilot you can deactivate the extension by clicking the copilot icon on the bottom right section of the screen.

## Keyboard Controls

CoPilot can be used with the keyboard. Here are some keyboard shortcuts that you can use:

-   `Alt + Enter` - Show CoPilot suggestions
-   `Alt + ]` - Move up in the CoPilot suggestions list
-   `Alt + [` - Move down in the CoPilot suggestions list
-   `Tab` - Accept the current CoPilot suggestion

## What are the main benefits for STEM students?

Students can use CoPilot to learn how to code by seeing snippets placed in the context of their hand written code. It can save time trying to configure multiple conflicting libraries and can help students learn how to use libraries.

Here are some examples of how CoPilot can help students learn how to code:

-   Students can use CoPilot to check their code for errors and to learn how to fix them.
-   Students can use CoPilot to learn how to use new libraries without having to read through the documentation in detail.
-   Students can describe what they want to do in plain English and CoPilot will show them the beginnings of a code snippet that they can use to get started.
-   Students can program in a language that they are not familiar with and CoPilot will help them learn how to use it.
-   Many students are visual learners. CoPilot lets them see multiple possible answers for each suggestion and lets them choose the one that best fits their needs.

## What are the main benefits for FRC teams?

CoPilot can help teams in many ways. Specifically, it can help teams see examples of how to use sensors and controllers in different ways. Students, mentors and coaches can use CoPilot to learn how to make the most of the hardware that they have.

Here are some examples of how CoPilot can help FRC teams:

-   Teams can use CoPilot to teach, demonstrate, and learn how to use advanced frameworks and libraries.
-   Teams can use CoPilot to learn how to use new sensors and motor controllers.
-   Teams can use CoPilot to learn how to use new programming languages.
-   Mentors can spend less time teaching the nitty gritty API changes and more time teaching the big picture concepts.
-   Coaches can use CoPilot to create lessons, guides and more with MarkDown, HTML and other methods.

## How can students and educators get the Student Resource Pack?

The Student Resource Pack is a free GitHub account that is available to students and educators. It comes with a free CoPilot account and a free GitHub Student Developer Pack. The GitHub Student Developer Pack comes with a lot of free software and services that can be used for FRC.

Students and educators should use a school email address to sign up for the Student Resource Pack. The Student Resource Pack is available at [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack). As part of the verification process, you will need to verify your current school enrollment. You can do this by uploading a copy of your school ID or by showing a recent document with your name an school letterhead or similar.

## How can students and educators use CoPilot?

Students and educators can use CoPilot in many ways outside of FRC. One method is to use CoPilot to create lessons, guides and more with MarkDown, HTML and other methods. Normally making a guide like this would take a lot of time and effort. With CoPilot, you can create a guide like this in roughly 1/2 the time at least.

Many of the topics you would want to cover in a guide can be covered with CoPilot. Here are some examples:

-   Computer Science Basics
-   Documentation and Technical Writing
-   Software Design
-   UI/UX Design
-   Organization and Project Management
-   Communication and Collaboration

## Tips and Tricks for using CoPilot

Here are some tips and tricks for using CoPilot:

-   CoPilot is still in beta. It is not perfect and it will make mistakes. It is important to check the code that it generates and to make sure that it is correct.
-   CoPilot is not a replacement for learning how to code. It is a tool that can help you learn how to code faster and more efficiently.
-   CoPilot is not a replacement for reading documentation. It is a tool that can help you learn how to use libraries faster and more efficiently.
-   CoPilot is not a replacement for learning how to use a programming language. It is a tool that can help you learn how to use a programming language faster and more efficiently.
-   When working with copilot it is important to be as specific as possible. The more specific you are, the better the code that CoPilot will generate.
-   CoPilot will use the rest of your code to help it generate code. It is important to make sure that you are not mixing too many different or corrupted projects into the same workspace in VS code.
-   When working with FRC projects, it is important to make sure that you are using the correct version of the WPILib libraries. CoPilot will use the libraries that are installed in your project to help it generate code. This applies to the 3rd party libraries that you use as well.
