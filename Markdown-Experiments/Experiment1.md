## What is CoPilot?

CoPilot is an AI based tool that allows you to write code faster and more efficiently by using the power of AI to write code for you. It is still in beta, but it is available right now for you to try out and use.

## Does it do everything?

No, it is not perfect. It is not able to write code from scratch. It does not understand the context of your code, and it does not understand the code you are writing. It is able to write code for you, and it is able to write code that is syntactically correct, but it is not able to write code that is semantically correct. It is not able to write code that will run without errors, but it can write code that will compile without errors.
