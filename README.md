# CoPilot Experiments Repository

 This is a repo for my Github CoPilot Experiments for Public use! The majority of the text is generated by CoPilot, but I have edited it to make it more readable or change important things. I have also added some my own Comments and give it structure to work from in most cases.

## What is CoPilot?

Github Copilot is a new AI-powered code completion tool that helps developers write code faster and more efficiently. It uses machine learning to understand the context of your code and suggests the best next line of code. It can also help you find bugs and improve your code quality.

### Does it do everything?

That depends on how you define everything. It can do a lot of things, but it is not perfect. It is still in Beta, and it is still learning. It is not a replacement for a human programmer, but it can help you write code faster and more efficiently.

### How does it aid programmers rather than replace them?

CoPilot can generate snippets based on the context of your code. While it has access to the entire Github codebase, it is not perfect. It can make mistakes, and it can generate code that is not correct. Even if it does generate code that is correct, it is not always the best way to do something. A human programmer needs to understand the language and the context of the code to know what is best. CoPilot can help you write code faster, but it cannot replace a human programmer.

### How does it work?

CoPilot uses machine learning to understand the context of your code and suggest the best next line of code. While writing code, CoPilot will suggest code snippets based on the context of your code. You can accept the suggestion or ignore it. If you accept the suggestion, CoPilot will add the code to your file. If you ignore the suggestion, CoPilot will learn from your decision and improve its suggestions in the future. There are keyboard shortcuts to accept or ignore suggestions or view the full list of suggestions.

#### What are the keyboard shortcuts?

-   `Tab` to accept a suggestion
-   `Alt + ]` next suggestion
-   `Alt + [` previous suggestion
-   `Ctrl + Enter` to view the full list of suggestions

### How do I use it with VSCode?

CoPilot is available in VSCode as an extension. You can install it from the VSCode Marketplace. Once you have installed it, you can enable it in the settings. You can also enable it for specific languages. Once you have enabled it, you can start using it. Below is a semi-comprehensive list of the languages that I have tested it with.

-   C
-   C++
-   Python
-   JavaScript
-   HTML
-   CSS
-   C#
-   Java
-   Arduino C
-   Markdown
-   JSON

### What are the licensing terms?

CoPilot is free for public repositories. For private repositories, you need to pay for a Github Pro or Team plan. You can find more information about the licensing terms on the Github Copilot website. This repository is public, so you can use it for free. I have also included the unlicense file in the repository.

### My Human Written Closing Thoughts as a Massive fan of Sci-Fi, Robots, AI and the Future

My favorite author is Douglas Adams, famous for the Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy Series, the Dirk Gently Series, Last Chance to See and Starship Titanic. He was a dreamer. Way back in 1990 he envisioned new interactive forms of Media in a video called Hyperland.

I can't speak for him, but I feel that if he was here, he would be prolonging writing another best selling classic to play around with this just like me. He always thought if he hadn't been a writer, he would have been a programmer. I think he would have loved this. While working on the Infocom Text Adventure version of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy with Steve Meretzky, Douglas Adams learned about the early days of AI known as expert systems with thousands of hand programmed branches of dialogue. 

Living at this time, being a programmer, engineer, dreamer and kid at heart, THIS IS THE DREAM!!!!!

Step forward into the future, and enjoy the ride. Thankfully Github isn't a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came.
